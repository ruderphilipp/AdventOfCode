     * Santa is delivering presents to an infinite two-dimensional grid of houses.
     * <p>
     * He begins by delivering a present to the house at his starting location, and then an elf at the North Pole calls
     * him via radio and tells him where to move next. Moves are always exactly one house to the north (^), south (v),
     * east (>), or west (<). After each move, he delivers another present to the house at his new location.
     * <p>
     * However, the elf back at the north pole has had a little too much eggnog, and so his directions are a little off,
     * and Santa ends up visiting some houses more than once. <b>How many houses receive at least one present?</b>
     * <p>
     * For example:
     * <ul>
     * <li> {@code >} delivers presents to 2 houses: one at the starting location,
     *      and one to the east.
     * <li> {@code ^>v<} delivers presents to 4 houses in a square, including
     *      twice to the house at his starting/ending location.
     * <li> {@code ^v^v^v^v^v} delivers a bunch of presents to some very lucky
     *      children at only 2 houses.
