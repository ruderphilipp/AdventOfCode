     * Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is sick! His nose isn't shining very brightly, and he needs medicine.
     * <p>
     * Red-Nosed Reindeer biology isn't similar to regular reindeer biology; Rudolph is going to need custom-made
     * medicine. Unfortunately, Red-Nosed Reindeer chemistry isn't similar to regular reindeer chemistry, either.
     * <p>
     * The North Pole is equipped with a Red-Nosed Reindeer nuclear fusion/fission plant, capable of constructing any
     * Red-Nosed Reindeer molecule you need. It works by starting with some input molecule and then doing a series of
     * replacements, one per step, until it has the right molecule.
     * <p>
     * However, the machine has to be calibrated before it can be used. Calibration involves determining the number of
     * molecules that can be generated in one step from a given starting point.
     * <p>
     * The machine replaces without regard for the surrounding characters. For example, given the string H2O, the
     * transition H => OO would result in OO2O.
     * <p>
     * Your puzzle input describes all the possible replacements and, at the bottom, the medicine molecule for which
     * you need to calibrate the machine. <strong>How many distinct molecules can be created</strong> after all the
     * different ways you can do one replacement on the medicine molecule?
